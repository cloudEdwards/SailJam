# Possible Direction: Cozy Atmospheric
- Add sail trimming (rotate mast)
- Check sail trim vs angle to wind
- 'Snap' to ideal sail trim; when trim is optimal for point of sail play animation, double move speed
- seagull sounds
- breaking wave sounds
- have wind particles increase in width and transparency over life so they have triangle-ish shape; skinny facing wind, wide downwind
